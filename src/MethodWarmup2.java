//TODO: create a class, MethodWarmup, and add an empty main method.
//        TODO: create a method, getDifference, that takes in two integers and returns the difference between the higher integer and the lower integer (subtract).
//        - If both integers are equal, the order of operands doesn’t matter in the calculation.
//        - If only one integer is passed, treat the calculation as if zero was passed as the second argument.
//        *** BONUS *** allow the method to accept two doubles and return a double output
